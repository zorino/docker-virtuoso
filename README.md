# Docker file for Virtuoso triplestore

## Running


You need to attach a volume into /mnt/graphs that contains at least a virtuoso.ini configuration file.


```
docker pull zorino/docker-virtuoso
docker run --name myvirtuoso -p 9000:9000 -v ./data:/mnt/graphs/ zorino/docker-virtuoso
```

To load triples from cmd line, create a **raw_data folder** inside your volume (**/mnt/graphs/raw_data**), put you raw triple files inside it (*.nq, *.nt,..) and execute the vt-utils CLI.

```
docker exec myvirtuoso vt-utils load '/mnt/graphs/raw_data' 'http://mygraph.org'
```

For other commands :
```
docker exec myvirtuoso vt-utils

vt-utils : virtuoso utilities cmd line
